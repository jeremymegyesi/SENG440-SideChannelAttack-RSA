# SENG440-SideChannelAttack-RSA
UVic SENG440 Project: Side Channel Attacks with RSA Encryption

# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to gain experience using software optimization and other techniques involved with embedded systems.
The selected project topic is Side Channel Attacks (SCA) paired with RSA encryption.
The project will involve developing C code on an ARM machine to perform RSA encryption while being robust to computation-time SCA by using a randomized computation time.
